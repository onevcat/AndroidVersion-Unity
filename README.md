AndroidVersion-Unity
====================

A simple Unity3D plugin which just returns Android version.

Copy files to same folders in your project, simply call `AndroidVersion.APILevel()` to get the current version of Android (see [here](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html) for more). `-1` will be returned in other platform or there is an error.
